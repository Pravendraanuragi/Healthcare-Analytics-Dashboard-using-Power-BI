# Healthcare Insights Dashboard using Power BI  

## Overview  
This project analyzes hospital data of 1000 patients across 5 hospitals using Power BI and Excel. The focus is on patient demographics, treatment costs, and recovery outcomes. The dashboard helps in identifying cost-effective treatments, improving patient care, and optimizing hospital resource allocation.  

## Tools and Skills  
- Power BI for interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- Excel for storing and managing patient and hospital data  
- Statistical analysis to identify trends and correlations  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Patient details: age, gender, diagnosis, treatment, admission/discharge dates, costs, recovery rating  
- Hospital details: hospital name, doctors, room details, daily cost of stay  

## Key Insights  
- Surgery is the most expensive treatment but does not always lead to the best recovery rates  
- Counseling and physical therapy are cost-effective with higher recovery outcomes  
- Senior patients show high variability in recovery, requiring age-specific care  
- Admission trends reveal seasonal peaks, helping in resource planning  

## Outcomes  
- Reduced treatment costs while maintaining or improving patient recovery  
- Efficient resource planning during high admission periods  
- Tailored treatment strategies based on patient age and recovery trends
